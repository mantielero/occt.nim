   *   Allocator for the Filler data.
   * @param isFullRandom
   *   Takes effect when the number of items is large (order of 50,000). When
   *   it is True, the code uses the maximal randomization allowing a better
   *   balanced tree. If False, the randomization/tree balance are worse but
   *   the tree filling is faster due to better utilisation of CPU L1/L2 cache.
